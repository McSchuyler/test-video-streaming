If you receive errors remeber that you need the easy movie texture asset:

Unity have plans to add HLS support so, in the future you will dont need easy movie texture, but by now, is the best player
for unity(better than the new video player).
I'll create a major version with all youtube features integrated then if you want to upgrade you will be able to pay only the difference.
